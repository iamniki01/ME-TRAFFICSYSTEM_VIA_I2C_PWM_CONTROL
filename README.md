# ME-TRAFFICSYSTEM_VIA_I2C_PWM_CONTROL
Abstract — With the technological advancement nowadays embedded has become a hot field for research. Embedded system is now used in almost all areas like security, transportation, medical equipment’s, military equipment’s etc. The major focus of this project is on the use of microcontroller I2C protocol and PCA9685 servo driver to implement a traffic light system. Here RPI GPIO2 and GPIO3 are used for I2C protocol with PCA9685 to control individual LED. With this feature we can control the level of dim and bright with PWM output. In this paper, the electronics and the software implementation to a traffic light system contains of two traffic lights that control the traffic on a narrow river bridge with only one line. Keywords: Raspberry Pi, LED, PWM Servo driver
